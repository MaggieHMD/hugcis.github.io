      <description>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a relatively new but already successful and productive subfield of machine learning, usually seen as part of Deep Learning. It is also often thought of as part of AutoML (see [1]). AutoML corresponds to finding ways of automating some of the most tedious aspect of machine learning and data science. It includes hyperparameter search, feature engineering and model selection among a growing catalog of battle tested algorithms as well as experimental models.</description>
