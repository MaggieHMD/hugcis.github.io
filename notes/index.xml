      <description>What is complexity?: The question is very much too vast to be answered in a written piece smaller than a whole book. I am planning on dedicating an entire post about measuring complexity with a range of metrics that people have come up with in the past. A big question I&amp;rsquo;m asking myself is: &amp;ldquo;How much does complexity depend on subjectivity and the observer?&amp;rdquo;</description>
