<h2 id="evolution-and-cas">Evolution and CAs</h2>
<p>Why would things <a href=
"/notes/20200301192607_evolution/">evolve</a> in a CA? I was
running interesting CAs for several 100s of thousands of steps
recently and realized that I did not really know what I would be
expecting to happen in one of those without any input from outside.
Could it be that, by just pure luck, some things start to evolve in
it? That some species or <em>life-like forms</em> emerge?</p>
<p>If this is even possible, what are the odds of this happening?
Was it how it worked in our case (earth)? Did just random particle
interactions in a large soup gave rise to a complete miracle? So
far from my experiment I have seen complex previously unseen
structures emerge during an automaton evolution, but this has never
gone farther than just a few big structures appearing and not
staying this way. I believe it is a bias to think that those
structures would have been suited to keep evolving because their
brittleness did not let them survive. Therefore the (unpractical)
way forward might be to let those things run and see what happens,
where the “surviving” would be the ones left after all this.</p>
<p>I’m wondering whether some kind of external input to those small
“universe” could help give rise to more complex behavior. Because I
am starting to think that even with the most efficient system
possible, the probability of seeing a <a href=
"/notes/20200301192936_complexity/">complex structure</a> appearing
decreases somewhat exponentially with the <em>complexity</em> of
the structure (or according to a power law).</p>
<p>Obviously I have no idea about all this and this is just based
on speculation. But I’ve yet to see reasonable evidence that we can
run a CA for a large number of time steps without any kind of input
and see this increase in complexity happen by itself. Maybe the key
would be to help it? But is it even possible?</p>

<p>I believe an exciting part of working on spontaneous emergence,
artificial evolution, and cellular automata is the fact that it
really feels like playing god with a <em>microverse</em>. Some
relevant recent pop-cultures examples include:</p>

<p>Love, Death & Robot <a href=

Episode 16: Ice Age</a></p>
<p>Each one of those cellular automaton is a universe, with is laws
of physics (update rule) and initial big bang-like configuration
(the initial state). Most combinations of the laws of physics are
not stable and create a completely disordered system, but some rare
configurations give rise to large structures sifting through space
and exhibit highly non-trivial macro behavior (2-3 cells wide up to
several 100s of cells-wide). Many of these structures interact in
different ways, some create siblings and children structures while
other get destroyed very quickly.</p>
<p>This transition from randomness to order could be seen in the
case of our universe as the 4 physical forces pulling together
particles into bigger and bigger structures which form a large
system with a lot of emptiness and some localized structures. In
this analogy, our planet and even our galaxy are just a microscopic
ripple on of those giant structures, but what if we could make this
kind of ripple happen in a much smaller universe, with much simpler
laws? This is more or less what we are trying to achieve with
cellular automata.</p>
<p>Obviously starting from scratch is hard, and it might not be
necessary to let this <em>microverse</em> evolve in a closed way
without interacting with it somehow.</p>

<p>Added: <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class=
"timestamp">[2020-02-21 Fri 10:48]</span></span></p>
<p>I am very attracted to this idea of coarse graining CAs. This is
reminiscent of physical systems where the inner working of a system
are mostly opaque to an observer and we only see a complex
macro-behavior. In the case of CAs this might be the key to
overcoming this problem of seemingly impossible increase of
complexity beyond a certain point if we keep looking at individual
cells. This also allows an external observer to understand a
comlpex behavior happening in billions of cells visually. It can be
done with <a href=

<p>I just realized that cellular automata and reaction-diffusion
systems are strongly related. This might be a well known fact but
it seemed particularly striking when looking at the following image
from <a id="1b843574876b0429c1d05e1428f7b42b" href=
"#manukyanLivingMesoscopicCellular2017a">(Manukyan et al.,
2017)</a> it seems clear that there is a continum between the two
models.</p>

<p>Added: <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class=

<p>Cellular automata can easily be represented as CNNs. This
relation has already been investigated in <a id=

"#gilpinCellularAutomataConvolutional2018">(Gilpin, 2018)</a> or

"#mordvintsevGrowingNeuralCellular2020">(Mordvintsev et al.,
2020)</a> for instance. This idea has advantages and drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computational cost of using floating points operations is
higher than discrete operations.</li>
<li>Discrete operations can lead to exponential growth of the
number of possible configurations and update rules in a CA.</li>
<li>The use of floating point operations is mainly there to be able
to compute gradients for gradient based optimization. This is
against a <em>non-supervised</em> philosophy I am trying to work
on.</li>
<li>Ultimately computations in a computer are discrete and
Mordvintsev et al. eventually use quantization to discretize the
CA, resulting in an approximation of a discrete automaton.</li>

<p>Some cellular automata have a characteristic “blob-preserving”
behavior where parts of the space get organized in large blobs.
This behavior is very similar to an application of <a href=

<p><a href="/notes/20200324162136-finite_state_machines/">Finite

dynamics of CAs for a number of reasons, among which we may note
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>FAs encompass the full range of behavior types from periodic to
complex to random;</li>
<li>Characterization of patterns using FAs makes possible a
definition of pattern complexity which is both natural and
computable in practice;</li>
<li>Ensemble evolution in the space of regular languages is closed

<li>The CA update rule is itself an FST;</li>
